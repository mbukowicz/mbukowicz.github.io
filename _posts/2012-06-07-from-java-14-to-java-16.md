<p>Recently, we were upgrading one of our legacy systems from Java 1.4 to 1.6. (<cite>If you wanted to know why we have not chosen Java 7, we were concerned about stability</cite>). We were afraid that despite we moved forward to a newer version of Java, our team would still not know how to use it. The whole effort would then seem fruitless.</p>

<p style="clear: both">It was obvious we needed a way to train our team. As a result I was chosen to give a presentation, where I tried to show what and how the features of Java 5/6 can be put to use. Here are the links for two versions of my presentation:</p>
<ul>  
	<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MateuszBukowicz/od-javy-14-do-javy-16">original one in Polish</a></li>  
	<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MateuszBukowicz/what-is-so-great-about-java-6">English version translated from Polish</a>, so everyone can benefit from my effort</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope you would find this presentation useful as a revision or as a mean to convince your client or boss to finally do an upgrade. By the way, if you want the original version of the presentation, where images' quality is much higher (slideshare messed it up a little bit), please let me know.</p>
