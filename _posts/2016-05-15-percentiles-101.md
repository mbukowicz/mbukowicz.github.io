When talking about statistics and monitoring *percentiles* immediately come
to my mind. What are those and why should you care?

What is a percentile?
-----------------------
Maybe you have not heard about percentiles, buy you may know what *median* is.

Suppose, you have 8 siblings. That is quite a family in these times. The table
below describes the heights of your family members:

Martin | Jeremy | Anna | Mom  | Mark | You  | Bob  | Dad  | Simon | Jenny
-------|--------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-------|-------
1m     | 1.1m   | 1.5m | 1.5m | 1.6m | 1.6m | 1.7m | 1.7m | 1.8m  | 1.9m

You and your brother Mark have median height in your family. It means that
you are separating the lower half of your family (like your mum) from the
higher half (represented by your dad).

According to [*Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median):

> Median is the number separating the higher half of a data sample
> from the lower half

Actually, *median* is a special case of a percentile called 50th percentile. Lets
again consult [*Wiki*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) on that:

> Percentile is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below
> which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall

If we take *Simon* as an example, he is the 90th percentile of your family. Only
10% of your family is higher than him (actually it is only Jenny, which is quite
extraordinary as she is your younger sister).

Percentiles in monitoring
-------------------------

Now that we have definition out of our way lets discuss how can we use percentiles
in practice. Percentiles are exceptionally useful when talking about latency,
however they are also a great tool for explaining decomposition of any other metric.

As an example lets take a look at the following chart:

![Percentile chart](/images/percentiles-101/percentiles_example.png)

If somebody asked you to describe the latency of requests served by your system
a chart like that proves to be invaluable. It is quite straightforward. You can
explain that 95% of your traffic is served with at most 240ms. 95% of requests
are handled even better: 60ms tops. You can go on about it forever.

This is all nice and dandy, but you have to be sure there is no clever guy in
the audience. You know, the one that is always asking questions.

Percentiles misuse
------------------

![Teenage pregnancy drops after age of 25](/images/percentiles-101/teenage_pregnancy_drops_after_25.jpg)

Percentiles are very useful. No one will argue with that. Unfortunately,
they can be also very misleading and are often (over/mis)used.

If you would like to learn about it I would strongly advise you to watch the
[**How NOT to Measure Latency**](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/latency-response-time)
presentation by Gil Tene. I could foolishly try to rephrase his words, but it
makes much more sense to see Mr Tene instead.

Max vs 99th percentile
----------------------

Going back to our example it is likely so, that our maximum values are much
greater than any 99th'ish percentile:

If you have not measured max values you could have been unintentionally lying
about the latency the whole damn time.

TLDR;
-----

* Use percentiles wisely
* Always measure max
* Watch Gil Tene's presentation: [**How NOT to Measure
Latency**](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/latency-response-time)
